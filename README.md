# P4 Getting Started

This repo contains various materials which have been compiled in a single location. This collection of resources provides everything you need in one place, in order to work through some P4 "hello world" exercises.

## Contents

* [P4 Overview](docs/overview.md) - A good place to start, this is a glossary of P4 terminology which should give an idea of how the various P4 components relate to each other
* [bmv2](docs/bmv2.md) - After reading the overview, this shows how to compile programes for the software switch based on the bmv2
* [Examples](docs/examples.md) - After reading the overview and bmv2 pages, next run various P4 example programs which provide working examples of different P4 features
